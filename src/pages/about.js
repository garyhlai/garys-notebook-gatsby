        Hi guys, My name is Gary Haizhi Lai and I am an indie maker and a
        freelance web dev. I recently graduated from Columbia University in NYC
        and set out to travel the world while working remotely. I invested a
        little bit of money in Ethereum back in 2016 which has bought me the
        opportunity to explore this kind of digital nomad lifestyle. I have been
        programming for two years but mostly just class projects, nothing
        serious. Now I have more time, I am super excited to unleash my
        creativity and actually ship things. I’m starting this blog here in
        order to share my notes on miscellaneous programming and traveling
        topics as I come across them. By explaining things, I can understand
        them better while providing values to others. Meanwhile, I hope to
        connect with and learn from fellow programmers and travelers who find my
        blog posts useful. I will start a regular newsletter soon - subscribe if
        you’d like to follow my notes and connect!
